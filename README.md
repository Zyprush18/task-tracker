# Task Tracker CLI

**Task Tracker CLI** is a simple command-line interface (CLI) application to manage your tasks. This tool allows you to add, update, delete, and track tasks efficiently based on their status.

## Features

- ✅ **Add Tasks**: Add new tasks with a description.
- ✏️ **Update Tasks**: Modify the description of an existing task.
- ❌ **Delete Tasks**: Remove tasks from the list.
- 🔄 **Mark Tasks**: Change the status of a task to `in-progress` or `done`.
- 📋 **List Tasks**: View all tasks or filter them by status (`todo`, `in-progress`, `done`).

## Task Structure

Each task contains the following properties:

- `id`: A unique identifier for the task.
- `description`: A short description of the task.
- `status`: The current status (`todo`, `in-progress`, or `done`).
- `createdAt`: Timestamp of when the task was created.
- `updatedAt`: Timestamp of the last time the task was updated.
